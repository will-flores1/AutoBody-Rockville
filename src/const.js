// 				"Unforeseen events might result in auto body damage, which makes finding the best repair shop more difficult. Finding the best repair facility is essential after you notice dents or other issues with your paint or auto body. Auto body shops evaluate body damage using a variety of criteria. The repair business examines your car before beginning the repair process. They can now see the genuine auto body damage thanks to this. Once it is located, the proper repair procedure is established, and the repair process starts. Different techniques are employed by auto body shops to fix dents and other damage. A trustworthy auto body shop will guide you through the full repair procedure. Choosing the ideal auto body shop is one of the most essential parts of the process. Ok now that that's out of the way, let's answer the question. Parts, labor, and other costs might cost anything from $100 to hundreds of dollars. You can research the cost of replacing the damaged parts, the length of the repair procedure, and the labor cost (say $90/hr) to get a general idea of how much it will cost to fix your car. Car bumpers typically cost between $500 and $1,500, and painting a damaged fender costs between $500 and $2,500.",
