## What is a totaled car?

Determining if a car is totaled can be a confusing process. If a car is considered totaled, that means the cost of repairs exceeds the value of the car. This is determined by your insurance company, if they believe it is not worth the repair or that it will not be safe to drive after the repair.

## What is the cut off?

Most insurance companies will declare your car "totaled" if the damages exceeds ~65%-75% of the cars value before the accident.

### Example

If your car was worth $10,000, and the cost to repair your car is ~$7,000, your insurance could claim your car to be "totaled"

## Things to consider

There are times when an estimate is made, accepted by insurance, and the repair process starts. Only to find out there is more damage that wasn't assessed at the time of the estimate. When this happens, an auto body shop will send a request to your insurance to repair the additional damage, but if this cost increases the repair past the ~65%-75% threshold, your car can be considered "totaled".
