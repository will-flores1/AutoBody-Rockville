# What is collision repair?

Collision repair is the process of repairing a vehicle that has been damaged in an accident. Whether it's a minor fender bender or a major collision, our team of skilled technicians can help get your car back to its pre-accident condition.

## How does it work?

At our auto body shop, we use the latest technology and equipment to ensure the highest quality repairs. We begin by assessing the damage to your vehicle and creating a repair plan that will get you back on the road as quickly as possible. This includes determining what parts need to be repaired or replaced, and the amount of time and cost required for the repair.

## What does it include?

Our services include:

- Body work: We repair dents, dings, and other damage to the body of your car, including the frame.
- Painting: We use high-quality paint and techniques to restore the original color and finish of your vehicle.
- Glass repair and replacement: We can repair or replace any broken or damaged auto glass.

We also work with insurance companies to make the claims process as seamless as possible for our customers. Our team can help you navigate the insurance claims process, and work with your insurance company to ensure you get the repairs you need.
