# What is paint repair?

Dent removal, also known as paintless dent repair (PDR), is a specialized process of removing dents and dings from a vehicle without affecting the original paint. At our auto body shop, we use the latest PDR techniques to ensure the highest quality dent removal.

## What does it include?

Our dent removal services include:

- Paintless dent repair: We use specialized tools to massage the dent out from behind the panel, restoring the panel to its original shape without affecting the paint.
- Hail damage repair: We can repair dents caused by hail, using the paintless dent repair (PDR) method.
- Door ding repair: We can repair small dents and dings on your vehicle's doors caused by other car doors or shopping carts.
- Large dent repair: We can repair larger dents and dings on your vehicle, depending on the location and severity of the damage.

PDR is a cost-effective and efficient method of dent removal, as it eliminates the need for traditional body fillers and repainting. It is also a preferred method by car dealerships and rental car companies because it preserves the original paint of the vehicle.

In addition to our dent removal services, we also offer a variety of other services such as collision repair, [auto painting](./paint-repair) and [auto detailing](./auto-detailing) to keep your car looking like new.

If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to us. We're here to help you keep your car looking its best.
