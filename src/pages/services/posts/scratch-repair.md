# What is scratch repair?

Scratch repair is the process of removing or reducing the visibility of scratches on a vehicle's paint. Scratches can be caused by a variety of factors, including keys, gravel, and other debris.

# What does it include?

Our services include:

- Minor scratch repair: We use specialized tools and products to buff and polish out minor scratches, restoring the paint's original shine.
- Medium scratch repair: For scratches that are deeper and more severe, we use a paint touch-up process that includes sanding, priming, and repainting the affected area, blending it with the original paint.
- Major scratch repair: When scratches are too deep and extensive, we use a full paint job to give a brand new look to the car.

In addition to our rust repair services, we also offer a variety of other services such as [collision repair](./collision-repair), [auto painting](./paint-repair) and [glass repair](./glass-repair-and-replacement) to keep your car looking like new.

Our team is dedicated to making sure that you are completely satisfied with the work we do on your vehicle. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to us. We're here to help you keep your car in top condition.
