# What is bumper repair?

Bumper repair is the process of repairing or replacing the bumpers of a vehicle that have been damaged in an accident or due to other causes. The bumpers are the panels located on the front and back of a vehicle, and they protect the vehicle from damage during low-speed collisions.

## What does it include?

Our services include:

- Bumper dent repair: We use specialized tools to remove dents and dings from the bumpers, restoring them to their original shape.
- Bumper replacement: If the bumpers are severely damaged and cannot be repaired, we can replace them with new ones.
- Bumper painting: We use high-quality paint to match the color of your vehicle's bumpers and restore their original finish.
- Bumper rust repair: We can remove rust from the bumpers and apply rust inhibitors to prevent it from returning and spreading.

In addition to our rust repair services, we also offer a variety of other services such as [collision repair](./collision-repair), [auto painting](./paint-repair) and [fender repair](./fender-repair) to keep your car looking like new.

Our team is dedicated to making sure that you are completely satisfied with the work we do on your vehicle. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to us. We're here to help you keep your car in top condition.
