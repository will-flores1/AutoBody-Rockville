# What is fender repair?

Fender repair is the process of repairing or replacing the fenders of a vehicle that have been damaged in an accident or due to other causes such as corrosion. The fenders are the panels that are located on the sides of a vehicle, and they protect the wheels and other parts of the car from debris and other environmental factors.

# What does it include?

Our services include:

- Fender dent repair: We use specialized tools to remove dents and dings from the fenders, restoring them to their original shape.
- Fender replacement: If the fenders are severely damaged and cannot be repaired, we can replace them with new ones.
- Fender painting: We use high-quality paint to match the color of your vehicle's fenders and restore their original finish.
- Fender rust repair: We can remove rust from the fenders and apply rust inhibitors to prevent it from returning and spreading.

In addition to our rust repair services, we also offer a variety of other services such as [collision repair](./collision-repair), [auto painting](./paint-repair) and [auto detailing](./auto-detailing) to keep your car looking like new.

Our team is dedicated to making sure that you are completely satisfied with the work we do on your vehicle. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to us. We're here to help you keep your car in top condition.
